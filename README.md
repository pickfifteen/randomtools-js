# randomtools-js

This is a port to JavaScript of the [randomtools](https://github.com/abyssonym/randomtools) project by [Abyssonym](https://twitter.com/abyssonym), originally written in Python. The purpose of the port is to allow development of entirely browser-based randomizers. For an example of usage, see the [EarthBound randomizer](https://github.com/stochaztic/eb-randomizer).
